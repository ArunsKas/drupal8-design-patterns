<h1>Adapter Pattern</h1>
<p>
    To translate one interface for a class into a compatible interface. An
    adapter allows classes to work together that normally could not because
    of incompatible interfaces by providing its interface to clients while
    using the original interface.
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
    <li>DB Client libraries adapter</li>
    <li>using multiple different webservices and adapters normalize data so
        that the outcome is the same for all</li>
</ul>
