<h1>Composite Pattern</h1>
<p>
    To treat a group of objects the same way as a single instance of the
    object.
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
    <li>a form class instance handles all its form elements like a single
        instance of the form, when ``render()`` is called, it subsequently
        runs through all its child elements and calls ``render()`` on them</li>
    <li>``Zend_Config``: a tree of configuration options, each one is a
        ``Zend_Config`` object itself</li>
</ul>
