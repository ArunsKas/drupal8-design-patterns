<h1>EAV Pattern</h1>
<p>
    The Entity–attribute–value (EAV) pattern in order to implement EAV model with PHP.

</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
    The Entity–attribute–value (EAV) model is a data model to describe entities
    where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used
    to describe them is potentially vast, but the number that will actually apply
    to a given entity is relatively modest.
