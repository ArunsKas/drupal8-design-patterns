<h1>Template Method Pattern</h1>

<p>
    Template Method is a behavioral design pattern.
</p>
<p>

    Perhaps you have encountered it many times already. The idea is to let
    subclasses of this abstract template "finish" the behavior of an
    algorithm.
</p>
<p>
    A.k.a the "Hollywood principle": "Don't call us, we call you." This
    class is not called by subclasses but the inverse. How? With abstraction
    of course.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, this is a skeleton of algorithm, well-suited for
    framework libraries. The user has just to implement one method and the
    superclass do the job.

    It is an easy way to decouple concrete classes and reduce copy-paste,
    that's why you'll find it everywhere.
